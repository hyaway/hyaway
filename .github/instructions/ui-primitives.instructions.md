# UI Primitives Development

Base UI components follow shadcn/ui patterns built on Base UI primitives.

- Use `npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]` to add new components
- Import directly from source files, not barrel exports
- Components use Tailwind CSS and CSS variables for theming

See [primitives.md](../docs/ui/primitives.md) for available components.
For Base UI primitives: https://base-ui.com/llms.txt
