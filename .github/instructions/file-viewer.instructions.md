# File Viewer Development

The file viewer displays individual files with:

- Type-specific viewers (image, video, audio, deleted, unsupported)
- Context navigation (prev/next within gallery context)
- File actions (trash, archive, download)
- Watch history tracking

See [file-viewer.md](../docs/features/file-viewer.md) for full documentation.
